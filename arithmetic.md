# Arithmetic Instructions

## ADD and SUB

### Purpose
Adds or subtracts values as expected.

### Operand Rules
- **Destination operand**: Can be r/mX or register
- **Source operand**: Can be r/mX, register, or immediate
- **Restriction**: No source and destination as r/mXs (would allow memory-to-memory transfer, which isn't allowed on x86)
